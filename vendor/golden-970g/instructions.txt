+==================================-

There are three main folders inside this zip file:
- compressed
- uncompressed
- templates


The folders 'compressed' & 'uncompressed' contain the generated framework 
(css, xhtml and background image file) .As the names imply the compressed
folder contains the css files in a compacted format which reduces the overall
file size.

- (un)compressed
	| XXX_XX_XX.html
	|- css
		| XXXX_XX_XX.css
		| reset.css (optional)
		| text.css (optional)
	|- images
		| XXXX_XX_XX.png
- templates
	| XXXX_XX_XX.png
	
You can choose to start out with the framework by using the 
complete contents of the 'compressed' or 'uncompressed' folder or copy the
css file (XXXX_XX_XX.css) to your website and include it
in the <head> of your HTML page.


Follow these instruction when using only the css file:
(Note: you may also use the reset.css and text.css files, or opt to leave them out.)

Here is an example of the XHTML code necessary to incorporate the CSS files:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/text.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/XXXX_XX_XX.css" />
</head>


The folder 'templates' contains a png file that you can use in Fireworks, 
Illustrator, OmniGraffle, Photoshop, Visio (etc.) to aid in prototyping and design.

I hope you find the generated framework useful and that it will help to speed up
your web development cycle!
