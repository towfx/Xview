BlueTrip CSS Framework
=======================================

A CSS grid-based framework born from the best parts of other frameworks, now with a life of its own.

USAGE
-----

Add the following four links to the <head> of your page::

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/print.css" type="text/css" media="print"> 
    <!--[if IE]>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/ie.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
    <![endif]-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">

Make sure you have the stylesheet links correct. 

Then edit "screen.css" to change `a[href^="http://yourwebsite.com"]` by putting your url in 
place of yourwebsite.com. This ensures that internal links will not show the external link icon.

Now get designing!
